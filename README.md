# Fediverse Archetypes

This document is a distillation of the **industrial-research** we did on the **Fediverse**.

This analysis is meant to be **descriptive**.
I.e., it is trying to list out what is there.
It is _not_ a statement of what should or shouldn't be there.
And neither is it an endorsement or a condemnation of anything that is there.
It is **description** of what seems to be observed.

⚠️ **This document tries to use _"neutral"_ language in its descriptions.** ⚠️

## Archetypes

> archetypes (noun): an idealized model of a number of similar things.

From the point-of-view of **industrial-research** — an **archetype** is a model of some aspect of a person shared among many people.

(UX people tend to call "**archetypes**": "**personas**".
And marketers tend to call "**archetypes": "**segments**".
In practice, all 3 of these are very similar concepts.)

Some examples of (non-Fediverse specific) **archetypes** include:

* father,
* mother,
* son,
* daughter
* brother,
* sister,
* husband,
* wife,
* gardener,
* farmer,
* computer programmer,
* grocery store cashier,
* CEO
* CTO
* etc.

You can also probably already see that an individual could express more than one **archetype**.
For example — a single individual could be — a _father_, a _husband_, a _brother_, a _son_, a _CTO_, and a _programmer_ during a certain span of their life.

The **archetypes** an individual expresses could also change over their life-time too.
For example — before someone has a child, they wouldn't be a _father_ or a _mother_ yet; but after they have a child, they would become a _father_, or a _mother_.

This document includes **archetypes** relevant to the Fediverse.
